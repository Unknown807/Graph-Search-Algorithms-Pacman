# Graph-Search-Algorithms-Pacman

An assignment done as part of my 'Introduction to A.I' module. This implements just the first project of the Berkeley Pacman projects.

Running a depth first search for a food dot, followed by running trickySearch for the shortest path to all food dots:

<div align="center">
  
<img src="/repo_imgs/img1.png" style="height:500px;"/>
  
<img src="/repo_imgs/img2.png" style="height:500px;"/>
  
</div>
