# Graph-Search-Algorithms-Pacman

An assignment done as part of my 'Introduction to A.I' module. This implements just the first project of the Berkeley Pacman projects.

Credit to Elena Botoeva, the lecturer for converting the base code from Python to Java.

# How it Looks

Running a depth first search for a food dot, followed by running trickySearch for the shortest path to all food dots:

<div align="center">
  
<img src="/repo_imgs/img1.png" style="height:500px;"/>
  
<img src="/repo_imgs/img2.png" style="height:500px;"/>
  
</div>
